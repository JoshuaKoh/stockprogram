Q. The program is crashing! What's wrong?
A. - Check that a bad string for "deviationOf" is not being given to calcStandardDeviation. If the "deviationOf" string does not exist as a key in the stocks dictionary, the program will break.

Q. All EMAs for a certain date are "None"!
A. This is likely because EMA calculation is being attempted on a stock over an interval from which that stock's SMA has not yet been calculated. Since the first EMA value relies on a corresponding SMA value, having no SMA value calculated over the specified time interval results in no EMAs being calculated.

Q. The database is filled with random characters and junk data.
A. - Check that a bad ticker was not listed in stocks.txt. The only test for bad tickers is a check for the Yahoo 404 page, and this is not always reliable. Make sure there are no poorly formatted tickers, and only one ticker per line.

Q. Testing a strategy reports 0 wins and 0 losses. Why?
A. - Check that your strategy has no typos which are messing up the reading and parsing of the strategy.
- Check that the value you are trying to work with is being calculated for the stock. For instance, if working with "macdAVG12", be sure macdAVG12 is actually a data point in the stock document.
